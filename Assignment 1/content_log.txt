I bring 8 months of hands -on experience as a Data Science and Machine Learning Intern, where I developed and optimized machine learning models, conducted in -depth data analysis, and contributed to projects such as Image Caption Generation and Car Price Prediction. My expertise span s across key data science methodologies. With a strong academic foundation and practical experience, I am eager to apply my analytical skills to derive actionable insights and d erive data -informed decision -making in a business environment. Experience Machine Learning Intern at PHN Technology Pvt. Ltd. Apr 23 – Jun 23 • Designed and developed 5+ Python scripts to connect to spreadsheets and databases. • Developed Machine learning models and validated, achieving 85% accuracy. • Performed data analysis on 10,000+ records, demonstrating insights into key trends. • Demonstrated data -driven insights and modelling results to data science team, enhancing decision -making processes. Data Science Intern at Oasis Infobyte Mar 23 – Apr 23 • Developed 5 deep learning models and used for regression and classification, with accuracy of 90%. • Performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing on datasets of 5,000+ entries, for data quality. • Used visualization modules to create 15+ graphs and charts, providing clear and actionable insights. Projects Image Caption Generator • Primary Goal : To develop an AI model that seamlessly convert visual data (images) to verbal format (captions) using Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing Techniques. • Solution: 1. Implemented Transfer Learning, employing CNNs of VGG16 pretrained model for feature extraction from images. 2. Created Bidirectional Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) network for generating descriptive captions. 3. Trained the model on the Flickr30k dataset, containing 30,000 images with 1,50,000 captions (5 captions per image). 4. Utilized Google Colab for computational resources to efficiently manage the training process. • Conclusion : Successfully developed and trained a model that generates descriptive captions for images . Mall Customer Clustering • Primary Goal: To develop a clustering model that effectively groups data into meaningful groups using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. • Solution: 1. Implemented K -means clustering, an unsupervised ML algorithm, to group the dataset in clusters. 2. Applied the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset. 3. Identified and selected 5 clusters based on the analysis. 4. Used 3 independent variables to create and visualize the 5 clusters within the dataset. • Conclusion : Successfully developed and visualized a clustering model Car Price Prediction • Primary Goal: To build a reliable model for Car Dealers, using clean dataset, and deploy it for user interaction. • Solution: 1. Acquired a dataset from Kaggle containing 19,237 entries and 17 independent variables. 2. Performed data cleaning, which reduced the size of dataset to 13,736 entries with 15 independent variables. 3. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights and select relevant features for the model. 4. Implemented multiple Supervised ML algorithms and selected the Random Forest Regressor due to its superior performance. 5. Created a webpage using Flask to deploy the model and make it accessible for dealers. • Conclusion : Successfully developed and deployed a Supervised ML model for car price prediction, with a simp le user interface.
